# CreatingDataProducts
The objective of this assignment is to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 
The webpage needs to be hosted on either GitHub Pages, RPubs. I chose to host it on RPubs.
We will use a dataset which has been sourced from the website “https://simplemaps.com/data/mx-cities”. 
The dataset will be loaded into a dataframe and it will be used to mark the capitals of 32 states of Mexico along with visualization of their population.
You can chose any country and make changes (to make it reproducible).
